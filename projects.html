        <h2>Gas Compressor Unit</h2>
        <p>
          Detailed design and engineering of a Gas Compressor unit, skid package
          with a positive displacement compressor, and separators to compress
          natural gas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designing the skid package with limited space on-site, we performed
          stress analysis and dynamic analysis for all process lines. The skid
          package area measures nearly 50′ X 42′.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also prepared engineering drawings and documents for all
          disciplines, including Process, Mechanical, Piping, and CSA.

        <h2>Gas De-hydration Unit</h2>
        <p>
          Provided detailed engineering scope & procurement support for gas
          dehydration unit. The purpose of a glycol dehydration unit is to
          remove water from natural gas and natural gas liquids, when produced
          from a reservoir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Involved in designing process & design data with equipment datasheets.
          Communicated with vendor based in USA for procurement of equipment.
          Actively participated in the purchase of available equipment along
          with client.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preparation of Process, Plant & Mechanical drawings & documents.
          Generation of 3D model.

        <h2>Yibal Laser Scan Modelling</h2>
        <p>
          Handled large-scale laser scan data and incorporated all discipline’s
          existing laser scan details into the 3D Model. Referred to existing
          deliverables and documents to update the 3D model and transform it
          into an Intelligent model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approximate laser scan area is 500′ x 500′, which was then
          converted to a 3D Model. Prepared all 3D Model reports from software
          without any manual intervention.

        <h2>Incinerator Package</h2>
        <p>
          Detailed design & engineering of Incineration packages and utility
          area. Designing high-end structure and arranged all equipment in
          critical existing area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prepared for all disciplines including Process, Mechanical, Piping and
          CSA drawings and documents. All Equipment designed in area 130’ X 50’.

        <h2>Gas De-hydration Unit Expansion</h2>
        <p>
          Provided detailed engineering expansion scope and procurement support
          for gas dehydration. The purpose of a glycol dehydration unit is to
          remove water from natural gas and natural gas liquids when produced
          from a reservoir.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were involved in designing process and design data with equipment
          datasheets. We also communicated with a vendor based in the USA for
          procurement of equipment and actively participated in the purchase of
          available equipment along with the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, we were responsible for the preparation of process,
          plant, and mechanical drawings & documents, as well as the generation
          of a 3D model.

        <h2>Oil & Water Console</h2>
        <p>
          Standardize Utility consoles by preparing detailed design solution for
          multiple project capacities. The purpose of standardizing console is
          to minimize engineering timeline by preparing ‘ready to execute
          engineering solution.’
